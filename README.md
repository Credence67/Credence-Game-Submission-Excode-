# Credence-Game-Submission-Excode-
This is a game submission for Excode.
My submission would be a turned-based game I made using python with the help from what I learned.

#Note:
The reason why I would make it here is to fix the lag issue by google colab. Colab stores hidden logs which can really lag out the text-based game.
Therefore, it is reasonable that I would be better if the code can be run locally.

The instruction will be as follows:

For Windows and Linux:
I can only provide the .py file. You will have to run it locally by typing [ python EXPLORMAN_GAME.py ] in your terminal equivalent. Do ensure that you have python3 is installed on your software.

For Mac:
Double-click the Mac Unix Executable file [EXPLORMAN_GAME_(MAC)]

Instructions will be as follows in the README.txt in the zip file.
Download the zip file by downloading the 'raw' file under EXPLORMAN_GAME_(V1.0).zip
